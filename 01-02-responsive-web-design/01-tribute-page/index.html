    <h2>A timeline of Peter Higgs' most notable achievements:</h2>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><strong>1929:</strong> born in Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.</li>
        <li><strong>1941-46:</strong> attends Cotham Grammar School in Bristol.</li>
        <li><strong>1950:</strong> graduates with a first class honours degree in Physics from King's College London.</li>
        <li><strong>1954:</strong> gets awarded a PhD for his thesis: <em>"Some Problems in the Theory of Molecular
                Vibrations."</em></li>
        <li><strong>1954-56:</strong> gets appointed as a Senior Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh.</li>
        <li><strong>1960:</strong> returns to the University of Edinburgh, taking up the post of Lecturer at the Tait
            Institute of Mathematical Physics.</li>
        <li><strong>1964:</strong> publishes the paper titled <em>"Broken Symmetries, Massless Particles and Gauge
                Fields,"</em> in Physics Letters 12, and then <em>"Broken Symmetries and the Masses of Gauge Bosons,"</em>
            in Physical Review Letters 13, where he predicts a new massive spin-zero boson.</li>
        <li><strong>1974:</strong> becomes a Fellow of the Fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE).</li>
        <li><strong>1983:</strong> gets elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).</li>
        <li><strong>1984:</strong> gets awarded the Rutherford Medal and Prize.</li>
        <li><strong>1996:</strong> retires and becomes Emeritus Professor at the University of Edinburgh.</li>
        <li><strong>1997:</strong> receives an honorary degree from the University of Bristol.</li>
        <li><strong>2008:</strong> receives an Honorary Fellowship from Swansea University.</li>
        <li><strong>2012:</strong> CERN announces that the existence of a Higgs-like boson has been experimentally
            established.</li>
        <li><strong>2013:</strong> the newly discovered particle was tentatively confirmed to be + parity and zero
            spin, two fundamental criteria of a Higgs boson, making it the first known fundamental scalar particle to
            be discovered in nature.</li>
        <li><strong>2013:</strong> shares the Nobel Prize in Physics with Francois Englebert "for the theoretical
            discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic
            particles".</li>
